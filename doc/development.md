# Development

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Pull the latest changes from the `master` branch.
2. Create your new (local) work branch.
3. Work on/commit your changes, see Development bellow.
4. Add an entry to the `Unreleased` section of `deploy/helm/CHANGELOG.md` describing your changes.
5. Push your branch to GitHub and create a Pull Request.
6. Once approved, the Pull Request can be merged with the `master` branch.

## Prerequisites

- [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev) at least [v2.0.3](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/releases/tag/v2.0.3)
  - On windows, do not install it using choco due to [this issue](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/issues/4058)
- [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io): `choco install kustomize`
- [Helm](https://helm.sh): `choco install kubernetes-helm`
- [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) with Kubernetes enabled

## Deployment

To run the collector in a local environment, execute:

```shell
skaffold dev
```

That will:

- build customized Otel Collector image
- deploy Prometheus
- deploy OtelEndpoint mock (to see that customized Otel Collector is sending metrics correctly)
- deploy customized Otel Collector

Possible issues:

- if you get errors like:

  ```text
  Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: failed to download https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts...
  ```

  or

  ```text
  Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: no cached repo found. (try 'helm repo update'): open C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp\helm\repository\stable-index.yaml: The system cannot find the file specified.
  ```

  you need to update Helm repo:

  ```shell
  helm repo update
  ```

- if you get error like

  ```text
  ...Unable to get an update from the "stable" chart repository (https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/):
          failed to fetch https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/index.yaml : 403 Forbidden
  ```

  you need to update path to a Helm repository:

  ```shell
  helm repo add "stable" "https://charts.helm.sh/stable" --force-update
  ```

## Develop against remote prometheus

You can port forward Prometheus server to localhost:9090 and run

```shell
skaffold dev -p=remote-prometheus
```

In order to change Prometheus endpoint that is hosted on HTTPS you can adjust skaffold.yaml file:

- add `otel.metrics.prometheus.scheme: https`
- update `otel.metrics.prometheus.url: <remote prometheus>`

## Integration tests
Integration tests are located in `tests/integration` and are supposed to verify if metric processing is delivering expected outcome.

### Prerequisites
Deploy cluster locally using `skaffold dev -p=only-mock` (configured to poll mocked data)
### Run tests locally
* Install all dependencies: `pip install --user -r tests/integration/requirements.txt` 
* Can be run in Visual Studio Code by opening individual tests and run `Python: Pytest` debug configuration
* You can run it directly in cluster by manually triggering `integration-test` CronJob

### Updating tests if processing is changed
* Open `launch.json`, Modify `WRITE_ACTUAL` environment variable in `Python: Pytest` debug configuration to `True`
* Run tests
* Read `actual.json`, format it to readable json, review it if it matches expected outcome and save it as `expected_output.json`

### Updating mocked data if new data are scraped
* Open/Create `.env` file and set `PROMETHEUS_HOST` variable from where you want to generate mocked data. For example `PROMETHEUS_HOST=localhost:8080`
* Open `utils/cleanup_mocked_prometheus_response.py`
* update `url` with request which our monitoring actually execute on prometheus
  * to get that you run `skaffold dev -p=only-mock` and check console output of `wiremock` pod, which logs full request it receive
* Run the script (`Python: File` in launch.json)
* Continue with `Updating tests if processing is changed`

## Publishing

### Docker image

Customized Otel Collector image is getting published to <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/solarwinds/swi-opentelemetry-collector>.

Steps to publish new version:

1. Create GitHub release selecting the Tag/branch you want to release with description of changes
   - use tag in semver format, it is the tag which Docker hub image will have publicly
   - publish release
2. GitHub action will be triggered that will build the release and wait for publish approval
3. after CODEOWNERS approve it, it will be published to Dockerhub public repository

### Helm Chart

Helm chart is published to <https://helm.solarwinds.com>.

1. Update property `version` in [deploy/helm/Chart.yaml](deploy/helm/Chart.yaml). (follow the [SemVer 2](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) format).
2. Update [deploy/helm/CHANGELOG.md](deploy/helm/CHANGELOG.md):
   1. Create release record with the right version and the date.
   2. Write all changes recorded in `Unreleased` section into the release.
3. Create PR for the changes to the `master` branch and merge them.
4. Run "Release Helm Chart" GitHub action workflow.
5. Find relevant release in GitHub, edit it and write all changes recorded into [CHANGELOG.md](deploy/helm/CHANGELOG.md) into its description.
6. Review PR that was created for the changes to the `gh-pages` branch and merge them.
