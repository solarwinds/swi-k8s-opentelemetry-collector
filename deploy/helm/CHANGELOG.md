## Unreleased

### Added

- Added possibility to deploy `PodMonitor` resources so that OTEL collector telemetry is scraped by Prometheus Operator (see [Prometheus Operator design](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/operator/design/))

## [2.2.0-alpha.3] - 2023-03-09

### Added

- k8s.namespace.name moved from attributes to resource.attributes
- Filtering out [internal metrics generated by Prometheus scraper](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/jobs_instances/#automatically-generated-labels-and-time-series) (`scrape_duration_seconds`, `scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling`, `scrape_samples_scraped`, `scrape_series_added`, `up`).
- introduced k8s.job.condition resource attribute for job which can be Pending, Complete or Failed
- introduced k8s.container.spec.cpu.limit metric for CPU quota

## [2.2.0-alpha.2] - 2023-03-02

### Added

- InitContainers where Prometheus and OTEL endpoints are checked
- Added metric k8s.kubernetes_build_info for calculation of sw.k8s.cluster.version

## [2.2.0-alpha.1] - 2023-02-21

### Added

- Collect metrics about kube jobs.
- Attribute k8s.pod.name to events
- Added internal ip attribute for node [#168](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/168).

## [2.1.0] - 2023-02-16

### Added

- Added telemetry port to kubernetes "ports" [#129](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/129)
- Added `tolerations` config of Logs collection DaemonSet (with default to run on tainted nodes) [#141](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/141)
- if telemetry is enabled (true by default) OTEL collectors will contain prometheus annotations so that telemetry is discovered by Prometheus [#152](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/152).
- configuration of `file_storage` extension is now available in `values.yaml`. [#157](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/157)
  - default `timeout` is now set to `5s`
  - Log collector suffix clusterId into folder which it mounts for checkpoints (e.q.`/var/lib/swo/checkpoints/<clusterId>`). This avoid unpredictable errors in scenario when previous monitoring was not deleted. [#161](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/161)
- new events transform pipeline which sets **sw.namespace** attribute to **sw.events.inframon.k8s** [#155](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/155).
  [#145](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/145).
- Exposed some configuration of [filelogreciever](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver) in `values.yaml` [#146](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/146).

### Changed

- Upgraded OTEL collector image to [0.3.0](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/releases/tag/0.3.0) which brings following changes
  - OTEL upgraded to 0.69.0
  - Added `filestorage` so it can be in processors

### Fixed

- Properly annotate configmap checksums [#151](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/151)
- Template now use `https_proxy_url` from the right place [#151(https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/151)
- Added optimizations to Log collector preventing Out of Memory situations [#137](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/137)
  - Added `filelog.storage` to persist checkpoints in persistent storage, not in memory.
  - Setting `max_concurrent_files` to 10 (from default 1024), this is main memory optimization, reducing amount of concurrent log scans
  - Increased default memory limit to `700Mi` (which should be enough for large logs)
  - Having by default `150Mi` difference between OTEL memory limit and Kubernetes memory limit, so that OTEL has enough buffer (this prevents OOMing)

## [2.1.0-beta.2] - 2023-02-15

### Changed

- Remove generated attribute k8s.deployment.name
- Log collector suffix clusterId into folder which it mounts for checkpoints (e.q.`/var/lib/swo/checkpoints/<clusterId>`). This avoid unpredictable errors in scenario when previous monitoring was not deleted. [#161](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/161)
