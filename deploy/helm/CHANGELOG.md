### Added
- New StatefulSet with light weight SWO Agent optionaly deployed by default

### Added

- Added telemetry port to kubernetes "ports" [#129](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/129)
- Added `tolerations` config of Logs collection DaemonSet (with default to run on tainted nodes) [#141](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/141)
- if telemetry is enabled (true by default) OTEL collectors will contain prometheus annotations so that telemetry is discovered by Prometheus [#152](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/152).
- configuration of `file_storage` extension is now available in `values.yaml`. [#157](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/157)
  - default `timeout` is now set to `5s`
  - Log collector suffix clusterId into folder which it mounts for checkpoints (e.q.`/var/lib/swo/checkpoints/<clusterId>`). This avoid unpredictable errors in scenario when previous monitoring was not deleted. [#161](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/161)
- new events transform pipeline which sets **sw.namespace** attribute to **sw.events.inframon.k8s** [#155](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/155).
  [#145](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/145).

### Changed

- Upgraded OTEL collector image to [0.3.0](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/releases/tag/0.3.0) which brings following changes
  - OTEL upgraded to 0.69.0
  - Added `filestorage` so it can be in processors

### Fixed

- Properly annotate configmap checksums [#151](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/151)
- Template now use `https_proxy_url` from the right place [#151(https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/151)
- Added optimizations to Log collector preventing Out of Memory situations [#137](https://github.com/solarwinds/swi-k8s-opentelemetry-collector/pull/137)
  - Added `filelog.storage` to persist checkpoints in persistent storage, not in memory.
